Day 1: Client-Server Architecture

Client: A machine or software that initiates a request for resources (e.g., browser, app).
Server: A machine or software that responds to the client's request (e.g., web server, database server).

Web Browsing: Your browser (client) requests a webpage from a web server.
Database Queries: A client app requests data from a database server

Communication Protocols in Client-Server Architecture

HTTP/HTTPS: Used for web browsing and secure web applications.
WebSocket: For real-time, bi-directional communication.
TCP: Ensures reliable communication with guaranteed delivery and order.
UDP: Focuses on speed and is used for applications that prioritize low latency over reliability.

2. Transport Layer -- transport portocls ensure safe transportation
3. Internet Layer -- routing of packets 

they packed into layers just because of thier functionality

Day 2: Understanding Communication Protocols and TCP/IP Model

Communication Protocols ensure proper data exchange and error handling between devices, defining rules for data format and transmission.
TCP/IP Model: Comprises four layers—Application (e.g., HTTP), Transport (e.g., TCP), Internet (e.g., IP), and Network Interface (e.g., Ethernet)—each handling different aspects of data communication.
Application Layer: Provides network services to applications (e.g., web browsing).
Hands-On: Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze packets, observing how the TCP/IP model’s layers function in real-world scenarios.

Day 3: Scalability and Load Balancing
1. Understanding Scalability
Scalability is a critical concept in system design, referring to the ability of a system to handle increased load or demand by adding resources. Here’s a more detailed look:

Types of Scalability
Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):

Definition: Involves increasing the capacity of a single server or machine by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.
Advantages:
Simplicity: Easier to implement and manage compared to horizontal scaling.
Consistency: Maintains a single point of access, simplifying application architecture.
Disadvantages:
Limitations: There's a physical limit to how much you can scale a single machine.
Single Point of Failure: If the server fails, the entire application can go down.
Example: Upgrading a database server from 16GB of RAM to 64GB to handle more queries.

Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):

Definition: Involves adding more servers or machines to a pool to distribute the load.
Advantages:
Elasticity: More flexible and can handle larger increases in load by simply adding more machines.
Redundancy: If one server fails, others can take over, improving fault tolerance.
Disadvantages:
Complexity: Requires more complex infrastructure and management, such as load balancers and distributed databases.
Consistency Challenges: Ensuring data consistency across multiple servers can be difficult.
Example: Adding more web servers to handle an increase in website traffic, so requests are distributed across multiple servers.

Scalability Strategies
Database Sharding:

Definition: Splitting a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards), each hosted on different servers.
Example: A user database is split by geographic region, with each shard handling users from a specific region.
Caching:

Definition: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response time.
Example: Using Redis or Memcached to cache user profiles so that database queries are minimized.
Stateless Design:

Definition: Designing applications so that each request is independent and contains all necessary information. This allows easy distribution across multiple servers.
Example: RESTful APIs are typically stateless, meaning each request carries all required data without relying on the server to maintain session state.
2. Understanding Load Balancing
Load Balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. Here’s a deeper look:

Types of Load Balancers
Hardware Load Balancers:

Definition: Physical devices dedicated to managing and distributing network traffic.
Advantages: Often provide high performance and advanced features.
Disadvantages: Expensive and less flexible compared to software solutions.
Example: A physical appliance from vendors like F5 Networks or Cisco.

Software Load Balancers:

Definition: Software solutions that run on general-purpose hardware or cloud infrastructure.
Advantages: More cost-effective and flexible; can be easily scaled or reconfigured.
Disadvantages: May require more management and configuration.
Example: Nginx, HAProxy, or AWS Elastic Load Balancing.

Load Balancing Algorithms
Round Robin:

Definition: Distributes each incoming request to the next server in a list, sequentially.
Advantages: Simple and easy to implement.
Disadvantages: Does not consider server load or capacity.
Example: Requests are sent to Server 1, then Server 2, then Server 3, and repeat.

Least Connections:

Definition: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
Advantages: Better distributes the load based on current server utilization.
Disadvantages: Requires real-time tracking of server connections.
Example: Requests are sent to the server that currently has the fewest open connections.

IP Hash:

Definition: Routes traffic based on the client’s IP address, ensuring that requests from the same IP address go to the same server.
Advantages: Useful for session persistence where clients need to maintain a connection with the same server.
Disadvantages: Can lead to uneven distribution if client IP addresses are not evenly distributed.
Example: Requests from IP 192.168.1.10 always go to Server 1.

Health Checks
Definition: Mechanisms to monitor the health and availability of servers.
Purpose: Ensure that traffic is only directed to servers that are operational.
Example: A load balancer periodically checks if servers respond to HTTP requests before routing traffic to them.
Hands-On Exercise
Implement a Load Balancer:

Setup: Install and configure Nginx or HAProxy as a load balancer on a test environment.
Configuration: Configure it to balance traffic across multiple backend web servers.
Simulate Traffic:

Tool: Use Apache JMeter or a similar tool to generate traffic and observe how the load balancer distributes requests.
Observation: Monitor server performance and load distribution.
Summary
Scalability: Understanding how to scale systems horizontally and vertically is crucial for managing increasing loads.
Load Balancing: Properly distributing traffic using various algorithms and ensuring server health is key to maintaining performance and reliability.
