Day 1: Client-Server Architecture

Client: A machine or software that initiates a request for resources (e.g., browser, app).
Server: A machine or software that responds to the client's request (e.g., web server, database server).

Web Browsing: Your browser (client) requests a webpage from a web server.
Database Queries: A client app requests data from a database server

Communication Protocols in Client-Server Architecture

HTTP/HTTPS: Used for web browsing and secure web applications.
WebSocket: For real-time, bi-directional communication.
TCP: Ensures reliable communication with guaranteed delivery and order.
UDP: Focuses on speed and is used for applications that prioritize low latency over reliability.
